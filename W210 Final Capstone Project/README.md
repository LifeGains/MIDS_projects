Goal:
- ML enabled stock picking system for retail investor.
- Retail investors do not have access to ML-driven quant funds in current day and age. Minimum = 100K, 1M+ to get access to quant funds, or are just closed to outsiders. Our platform is a ML driven stock selection solution for retail investors for a very low minimum.

Role:
- Due to expertise in finance, I spearheaded feature engineering/ selection/ creation portion. 50 out of 130 features were significant, PCA & SHAP to narrow down number of features.

Impact:
- Accuracy was low 55-60% with XGBoost + Gridsearch. However, despite low accuracy, the winning picks outperformed the losing picks. Over roughly 20 years (2003-2022), we outperformed the SPX by 2x.
