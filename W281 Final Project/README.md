# W281: Image Classification

## Goal
- Accurately classify 20 different animal classes with a tiny dataset. Use different image manipulation/ image processing techniques to preprocess the images before using them to train several ML models.
- We donâ€™t need to go into why image classification is important. Google: Search by image, Google Photos, search by face. Extremely important and useful if an algo can correctly classify images without human labeling.
