## W210 Capstone: StockpickAI
Predicts which 5 stocks (on a monthly basis) are the most likely to outperform the S&P 500 over the next year.

Results/Model: 55-60% Accuracy: XGBoost

Tools: Python, SQL / Amazon AWS (EC2, S3) / XGBoost, Random Forest

## W207 Introduction to Machine Learning: Stock Prediction Model								
Create a stock prediction model that maximizes both prediction accuracy and returns (“utility score”)

Results/Model: 52% Accuracy: Naive Bayes

Tools: Python / GCP / Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTM), K Means Clustering, PCA, Naive Bayes

## W261 Machine Learning at Scale: Flight Delay Prediction, Github								
Predict flight delays to decrease explicit (financial) and implicit (time) costs for both airlines and consumers alike

Results/Model: 84% Recall: Random Forest (% of delayed flights that are correctly classified as delayed)

Tools: Python / Databricks / Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression

## W266 Natural Language Processing (NLP): Subreddit Classification, Github								
Accurately classify slang-heavy social media posts (using NLP techniques) in order to attract higher ad spending

Hypothesis: Classification of deslanged social media posts will outperform those with slang/acronyms
Results/Model: 86% F1 Score: BERT

Tools: Python / Deep Learning (BERT, T5, Recurrent Neural Networks), Naive Bayes

## W281 Computer Vision: Image Classification, Github								
Simulate computer vision by classifying 20 animal types (image processing/manipulation, feature engineering, machine learning)
Combination of low amount of training data and compute resources yielded a low scoring model.

Results/Model: 31% F1 Score: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Tools: Python / Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks), SVM, ResNet, PCA, T-SNE, Sobel, Harris Corners

## W203 Statistics for Data Science: Impact of Patient Race vs. State Hospital’s Preparedness on COVID Mortality Rates, Github				
Determine if race or hospital preparedness is more important with respect to mortality rates

Purpose: To fact check news reports stating that race was a significant factor

Results: State hospital preparedness held higher significance (higher coefficient value)

Tools: R / Linear & Logistic Regression
